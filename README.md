Centralized data for coffee shop expansion

# Coffee Shop Data Engineering Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Coffee Shop Data Engineering Project! In this initiative, we aim to expand our New York-based coffee shop chain nationwide by improving operational efficiency and revamping our data infrastructure. As the Data Engineer on board, my role is to design a robust relational database system that enables data-driven decisions for our executives.

## Project Scope

### Data Consolidation
- Our current data landscape is diverse, including data from accounting software, suppliers' databases, point-of-sale (POS) systems, and spreadsheets. My task is to consolidate this data into a central database for unified access.

### Database Design
- I will create and implement the necessary database objects, ensuring data integrity and security in the process.

### Data Loading
- Once the database structure is established, I'll develop processes to load the database with source data while maintaining data quality.

### Data Subsetting
- To meet the specific needs of our business partners, I'll create data subsets, export them, and prepare them for loading into staging databases with different RDBMS.

## Project Goals

1. **Efficiency:** Streamline operations by centralizing data, reducing manual data handling, and automating integration.

2. **Data-Driven Decisions:** Provide executives with timely, accurate insights for informed decision-making and nationwide expansion.

3. **Data Quality:** Ensure data integrity and consistency, minimizing errors and discrepancies.

4. **Scalability:** Design a system capable of scaling as our franchise network grows.
